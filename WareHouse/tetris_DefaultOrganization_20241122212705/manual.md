## 2. Game Controls

The controls for the Tetris game are as follows:

- **Up Arrow**: Rotate the current piece.
- **Left Arrow**: Move the current piece to the left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move the current piece to the right.
- **Down Arrow**: Move the current piece down faster.
- **Space**: Drop the current piece to the bottom.

## 3. Game Rules

The objective of the Tetris game is to clear lines by filling them with blocks. The game starts with an empty grid, and random tetromino pieces (composed of four blocks) fall from the top of the grid. You can move and rotate the pieces to fit them into the grid. When a horizontal line is completely filled with blocks, it is cleared, and the player earns points.

## 4. Scoring

The scoring system in Tetris is as follows:

- **Single Line Clear**: 100 points
- **Double Line Clear**: 300 points
- **Triple Line Clear**: 500 points
- **Tetris (Four Line Clear)**: 800 points

The more lines you clear at once, the higher your score will be.

## 5. Game Over

The game ends when the stack of tetromino pieces reaches the top of the grid. When the game is over, a "Game Over" message will be displayed on the screen. You can start a new game by pressing any key.

## 6. Troubleshooting
