I think for this task, we should consider creating a game application to develop a Tetris game. This would allow us to implement the visualized game using Python, which falls within our expertise and capabilities.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "テトリスを作りたい".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Unimplemented File:
"tetromino.py"
In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the tetromino.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the tetromino.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statement for the Tetromino class in the tetris.py file. To fix this, add the following line at the top of the tetris.py file:

```python
from tetromino import Tetromino
```

This will ensure that the Tetromino class is properly imported and can be used in the Tetris class.

The provided code is a basic implementation of the Tetris game using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game logic is implemented in the `Tetris` class in the `tetris.py` file, and the Tetromino pieces are represented by the `Tetromino` class in the `tetromino.py` file.

To further improve the code and make it more robust, you can consider the following suggestions:

1. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and class.
2. Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's score.
3. Add sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
4. Implement a pause and resume functionality.
5. Implement a high score system to keep track of the top scores.
6. Add a game over screen with options to restart or quit the game.
7. Implement different levels with increasing difficulty.
8. Add animations and visual effects to make the game more visually appealing.

By incorporating these suggestions, you can create a more polished and enjoyable Tetris game.

The provided code is a basic implementation of the Tetris game using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game logic is implemented in the `Tetris` class in the `tetris.py` file, and the Tetromino pieces are represented by the `Tetromino` class in the `tetromino.py` file.

To further improve the code and make it more robust, you can consider the following suggestions:

1. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and class.
2. Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's score.
3. Add sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
4. Implement a pause and resume functionality.
5. Implement a high score system to keep track of the top scores.
6. Add a game over screen with options to restart or quit the game.
7. Implement different levels with increasing difficulty.
8. Add animations and visual effects to make the game more visually appealing.

By incorporating these suggestions, you can create a more polished and enjoyable Tetris game.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: テトリスを作りたい.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statement for the `Tetromino` class in the `tetris.py` file. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `tetris.py` file:

```python
from tetromino import Tetromino
```

This will ensure that the `Tetromino` class is properly imported and can be used in the `Tetris` class.

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

[2024-16-11 12:44:27 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 <COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statement for the `Tetromino` class in the `tetris.py` file. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `tetris.py` file:

```python
from tetromino import Tetromino
```

This will ensure that the `Tetromino` class is properly imported and can be used in the `Tetris` class.

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

graphical user interface. The game logic is implemented in the Tetris class in the tetris.py file, and the Tetromino pieces are represented by the Tetromino class in the tetromino.py file.\n\nTo further improve the code and make it more robust, you can consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and class.\n2. Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player\'s score.\n3. Add sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.\n4. Implement a pause and resume functionality.\n5. Implement a high score system to keep track of the top scores.\n6. Add a game over screen with options to restart or quit the game.\n7. Implement different levels with increasing difficulty.\n8. Add animations and visual effects to make the game more visually appealing.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, you can create a more polished and enjoyable Tetris game.', 'cycle_index': 2, 'task':

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statement for the `Tetromino` class in the `tetris.py` file. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `tetris.py` file:

```python
from tetromino import Tetromino
```

This will ensure that the `Tetromino` class is properly imported and can be used in the `Tetris` class.

Once you have made this change, the code should be able to run without any import errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statement for the `tkinter` module in the `tetromino.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to create a `Canvas` object in the `Tetris` class.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `tetromino.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the `Canvas` class is available for use in the `Tetris` class.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the import statement for the `tkinter` module in the `tetromino.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to create a `Canvas` object in the `Tetris` class.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the `tetromino.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the `Canvas` class is available for use in the `Tetris` class."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: テトリスを作りたい.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is in the `check_collision` method of the `Tetris` class. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the `shape` attribute of the `current_piece` object, which is `None`.

The error message indicates that the `current_piece` object is of type `NoneType`, meaning it is not assigned a value. This can happen when the `current_piece` is not initialized or when it is set to `None` intentionally.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `current_piece` is properly initialized before calling the `check_collision` method. You can do this by assigning a new piece to `current_piece` when it is `None` in the `update` method.

Here's the updated code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self):
    if not self.is_game_over:
        if self.current_piece is None:
            self.current_piece = self.next_piece
            self.next_piece = self.generate_piece()
            if self.check_collision(self.current_piece):
                self.is_game_over = True
                self.canvas.create_text(150, 300, text="Game Over", font=("Arial", 36), fill="white")
            else:
                self.draw_piece(self.current_piece)
        else:
            self.move_down()
    self.root.after(1000 // self.level, self.update)
```

With this fix, the `current_piece` will be properly initialized before checking for collisions, preventing the `NoneType` error.

        else:
            self.move_down()
    self.root.after(1000 // self.level, self.update)
```

With this fix, the `current_piece` will be properly initialized before checking for collisions, preventing the `NoneType` error.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is in the `check_collision` method of the `Tetris` class. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the `shape` attribute of the `current_piece` object, which is `None`.

The error message indicates that the `current_piece` object is of type `NoneType`, meaning it is not assigned a value. This can happen when the `current_piece` is not initialized or when it is set to `None` intentionally.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `current_piece` is properly initialized before calling the `check_collision` method. You can do this by assigning a new piece to `current_piece` when it is `None` in the `update` method.

Here's the updated code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self):
    if not self.is_game_over:
        if self.current_piece is None:
            self.current_piece = self.next_piece
            self.next_piece = self.generate_piece()
            if self.check_collision(self.current_piece):
                self.is_game_over = True
                self.canvas.create_text(150, 300, text="Game Over", font=("Arial", 36), fill="white")
            else:
                self.draw_piece(self.current_piece)
        else:
            self.move_down()
    self.root.after(1000 // self.level, self.update)
```

With this fix, the `current_piece` will be properly initialized before checking for collisions, preventing the `NoneType` error."

This can happen when the current_piece is not initialized or when it is set to None intentionally.\n\nTo fix this bug, you need to ensure that the current_piece is properly initialized before calling the check_collision method.

Here is a new customer's task: テトリスを作りたい.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is in the `update` method of the `Tetris` class. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the `shape` attribute of the `current_piece` object, which is `None`. This indicates that the `current_piece` is not being properly initialized or assigned a value.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `current_piece` is correctly assigned a value before accessing its attributes. One possible solution is to modify the `start` method to generate the first piece and assign it to `current_piece` before starting the game loop. Here's the updated code:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<Up>", self.rotate_piece)
    
    # Generate the first piece and assign it to current_piece
    self.current_piece = self.generate_piece()
    
    self.root.after(1000, self.update)
```

With this fix, the `current_piece` will be properly initialized, and the error should no longer occur.

update method of the Tetris class. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the shape attribute of the current_piece object, which is None. This indicates that the current_piece is not being properly initialized or assigned a value.\n\nTo fix this bug, you need to ensure that the current_piece is correctly assigned a value before accessing its attributes. One possible solution is to modify the start method to generate the first piece and assign it to current_piece before starting the game loop. Here\'s the updated code:\n\npython\ndef start(self):\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Left&gt;", self.move_left)\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Right&gt;", self.move_right)\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Down&gt;", self.move_down)\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Up&gt;", self.rotate_piece)\n    \n    # Generate the first piece and assign it to current_piece\n    self.current_piece = self.generate_piece()\n    \n    self.root.after(1000, self.update)\n\n\nWith this fix, the current_piece will be properly initialized, and the error should no longer occur.'} |

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is in the `update` method of the `Tetris` class. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the `shape` attribute of the `current_piece` object, which is `None`. This indicates that the `current_piece` is not being properly initialized or assigned a value.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `current_piece` is correctly assigned a value before accessing its attributes. One possible solution is to modify the `start` method to generate the first piece and assign it to `current_piece` before starting the game loop. Here's the updated code:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<Up>", self.rotate_piece)
    
    # Generate the first piece and assign it to current_piece
    self.current_piece = self.generate_piece()
    
    self.root.after(1000, self.update)
```

With this fix, the `current_piece` will be properly initialized, and the error should no longer occur."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

update method of the Tetris class. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the shape attribute of the current_piece object, which is None. This indicates that the current_piece is not being properly initialized or assigned a value.\n\nTo fix this bug, you need to ensure that the current_piece is correctly assigned a value before accessing its attributes. One possible solution is to modify the start method to generate the first piece and assign it to current_piece before starting the game loop. Here\'s the updated code:\n\npython\ndef start(self):\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Left&gt;", self.move_left)\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Right&gt;", self.move_right)\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Down&gt;", self.move_down)\n    self.root.bind("&lt;Up&gt;", self.rotate_piece)\n    \n    # Generate the first piece and assign it to current_piece\n    self.current_piece = self.generate_piece()\n    \n    self.root.after(1000, self.update)\n\n\nWith this fix, the current_piece will be properly initialized, and the error should no longer occur.'} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: テトリスを作りたい.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is in the `update` method of the `Tetris` class. Specifically, the error occurs when checking for collision in the `check_collision` method with the `current_piece` object, which is `None`. This is because the `current_piece` is not initialized correctly in the `start` method.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the `start` method in the `Tetris` class. Here's the updated code:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<Up>", self.rotate_piece)
    self.next_piece = self.generate_piece()  # Initialize the next_piece
    self.update()  # Start the game loop
```

By initializing the `next_piece` before calling the `update` method, you ensure that the `current_piece` is not `None` when the collision check is performed.

After making this change, the bug causing the `NoneType` error should be resolved.

Error Summary of Test Reports:
"Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is in the `update` method of the `Tetris` class. Specifically, the error occurs when checking for collision in the `check_collision` method with the `current_piece` object, which is `None`. This is because the `current_piece` is not initialized correctly in the `start` method.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the `start` method in the `Tetris` class. Here's the updated code:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<Up>", self.rotate_piece)
    self.next_piece = self.generate_piece()  # Initialize the next_piece
    self.update()  # Start the game loop
```

By initializing the `next_piece` before calling the `update` method, you ensure that the `current_piece` is not `None` when the collision check is performed.

After making this change, the bug causing the `NoneType` error should be resolved."
Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete "TODO" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

```

The bug causing the problem has been fixed by initializing the `next_piece` before calling the `update` method in the `start` function. The `check_collision` method has also been modified to handle the case when `piece` is `None`.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes:  "{codes}" Requirements: "{requirements}" As the {assistant_role}, by using Markdown, you should write a manual.md file which is a detailed user manual to use the software, including introducing main functions of the software, how to install environment dependencies and how to use/play it. For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

   ```
   python -m venv tetris-env
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system:

   - For Windows:

     ```
     tetris-env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source tetris-env/bin/activate
     ```

6. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. Once the installation is complete, you are ready to play Tetris!

## Usage

To start playing Tetris, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Tetris source code files.

2. Make sure the virtual environment is activated (if you created one).

3. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. A new window will open with the Tetris game interface.

5. Use the following keyboard controls to play the game:

   - **Left Arrow**: Move the current piece to the left.
   - **Right Arrow**: Move the current piece to the right.
   - **Down Arrow**: Move the current piece down faster.
   - **Up Arrow**: Rotate the current piece.

6. The goal of the game is to complete horizontal lines by filling them with Tetromino pieces. When a line is completed, it will be cleared, and you will earn points. The game ends when the Tetromino pieces reach the top of the game board.

7. Enjoy playing Tetris!
