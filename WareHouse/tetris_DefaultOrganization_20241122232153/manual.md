## 2. Game Controls

The controls for the Tetris game are as follows:

- **Left Arrow**: Move the current piece to the left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move the current piece to the right.
- **Down Arrow**: Move the current piece down faster.
- **Space**: Rotate the current piece.

## 3. Playing the Game

The objective of Tetris is to clear lines by filling them with blocks. The game starts with an empty grid, and random pieces consisting of four blocks each fall from the top of the grid. You can move and rotate the pieces to fit them into the grid.

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the current piece horizontally.
2. Use the down arrow key to move the current piece down faster.
3. Use the space key to rotate the current piece.
4. Try to fit the pieces together to form complete lines.
5. When a line is complete, it will be cleared, and you will earn points.
6. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the grid and there is no more space to place new pieces.

## 4. Scoring

You earn points in Tetris by clearing lines. The scoring system is as follows:

- **1 line**: 100 points
- **2 lines**: 300 points
- **3 lines**: 500 points
- **4 lines**: 800 points

Try to clear as many lines as possible to achieve a high score!

## 5. Game Over

The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the grid and there is no more space to place new pieces. At that point, your score will be displayed, and you can choose to play again by closing and reopening the game window.

Enjoy playing Tetris and have fun!
