We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

This is a basic implementation of the Tetris game using Python and tkinter for the GUI. The main file `main.py` sets up the tkinter window and starts the game by creating an instance of the Tetris class. The Tetris class in `tetris.py` handles the game logic, including drawing the game board, moving and rotating pieces, and updating the game state. The game loop is implemented using the `after` method of tkinter to continuously update the game at a fixed interval. The move functions are currently empty and need to be implemented to handle the movement of the Tetris pieces.

```

Now, the tetris.py file has been implemented with the necessary methods for the Tetris game logic. You can use this code to run the Tetris game in Python.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Tetris` class is missing the implementation of the `draw_piece`, `lock_piece`, and `is_valid_move` methods. These methods are essential for the game logic and need to be implemented for the Tetris game to function correctly.

To fix this, you need to add the following code to the `Tetris` class:

```python
def draw_piece(self):
    for row in range(len(self.current_piece)):
        for col in range(len(self.current_piece[row])):
            if self.current_piece[row][col] == 1:
                self.board[self.current_piece_row + row][self.current_piece_col + col] = 1

def lock_piece(self):
    for row in range(len(self.current_piece)):
        for col in range(len(self.current_piece[row])):
            if self.current_piece[row][col] == 1:
                self.board[self.current_piece_row + row][self.current_piece_col + col] = 1
    self.current_piece = None

def is_valid_move(self, piece, row, col):
    for piece_row in range(len(piece)):
        for piece_col in range(len(piece[piece_row])):
            if piece[piece_row][piece_col] == 1:
                if row + piece_row < 0 or row + piece_row >= len(self.board) or col + piece_col < 0 or col + piece_col >= len(self.board[0]) or self.board[row + piece_row][col + piece_col] == 1:
                    return False
    return True
```

Once you have added these methods, the Tetris game should function correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Tetris` class is missing the implementation of the `draw_piece`, `lock_piece`, and `is_valid_move` methods. These methods are essential for the game logic and need to be implemented for the Tetris game to function correctly.

To fix this, you need to add the following code to the `Tetris` class:

```python
def draw_piece(self):
    for row in range(len(self.current_piece)):
        for col in range(len(self.current_piece[row])):
            if self.current_piece[row][col] == 1:
                self.board[self.current_piece_row + row][self.current_piece_col + col] = 1

def lock_piece(self):
    for row in range(len(self.current_piece)):
        for col in range(len(self.current_piece[row])):
            if self.current_piece[row][col] == 1:
                self.board[self.current_piece_row + row][self.current_piece_col + col] = 1
    self.current_piece = None

def is_valid_move(self, piece, row, col):
    for piece_row in range(len(piece)):
        for piece_col in range(len(piece[piece_row])):
            if piece[piece_row][piece_col] == 1:
                if row + piece_row < 0 or row + piece_row >= len(self.board) or col + piece_col < 0 or col + piece_col >= len(self.board[0]) or self.board[row + piece_row][col + piece_col] == 1:
                    return False
    return True
```

Once you have added these methods, the Tetris game should function correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Please note that the code provided above is a modified version of the original code. I have added the missing methods `draw_piece`, `lock_piece`, and `is_valid_move` to the `Tetris` class. These methods are essential for the game logic and ensure the Tetris game functions correctly.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Tetris` class is missing the implementation of the `start` method. This method is responsible for binding the keyboard events and starting the game loop. Without this method, the game will not be playable.

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `start` method in the `Tetris` class. Here's an example of how it can be done:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<space>", self.rotate_piece)
    self.root.after(1000, self.update)
```

Make sure to add this method to the `Tetris` class in the `tetris.py` file. Once you've made this change, the game should be playable.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Tetris` class is missing the implementation of the `start` method. This method is responsible for binding the keyboard events and starting the game loop. Without this method, the game will not be playable.

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `start` method in the `Tetris` class. Here's an example of how it can be done:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<space>", self.rotate_piece)
    self.root.after(1000, self.update)
```

Make sure to add this method to the `Tetris` class in the `tetris.py` file. Once you've made this change, the game should be playable."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Once you\'ve made this change, the game should be playable.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority comment is that the `Tetris` class is missing the implementation of the `start` method. This method is responsible for binding the keyboard events and starting the game loop. Without this method, the game will not be playable.

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `start` method in the `Tetris` class. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<space>", self.rotate_piece)
    self.root.after(1000, self.update)
```

Make sure to add this method to the `Tetris` class in the `tetris.py` file.

Once you've made this change, the game should be playable and respond to keyboard events.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Tetris` class is missing the implementation of the `start` method. This method is responsible for binding the keyboard events and starting the game loop. Without this method, the game will not be playable.

To fix this, you need to add the implementation of the `start` method in the `Tetris` class. Here's an example of how it can be implemented:

```python
def start(self):
    self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
    self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
    self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
    self.root.bind("<space>", self.rotate_piece)
    self.root.after(1000, self.update)
```

Make sure to add this method to the `Tetris` class in the `tetris.py` file.

Once you've made this change, the game should be playable and respond to keyboard events."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Here is a new customer's task: テトリスを作りたい.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the Tetris project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

requirements.txt

```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the Tetris project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
```
The tkinter package is required for the Tetris game as it provides the graphical user interface (GUI) functionality. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

## 1. Installation

To install and run the Tetris game, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone or download the Tetris repository from the ChatDev GitHub page (https://github.com/ChatDev/Tetris).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Tetris repository.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies, including the `tkinter` library.

5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the game by running the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   The Tetris game window should now open, and you are ready to play!

## 2. Game Controls

The controls for the Tetris game are as follows:

- **Left Arrow**: Move the current piece to the left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move the current piece to the right.
- **Down Arrow**: Move the current piece down faster.
- **Space**: Rotate the current piece.

## 3. Playing the Game

The objective of Tetris is to clear lines by filling them with blocks. The game starts with an empty grid, and random pieces consisting of four blocks each fall from the top of the grid. You can move and rotate the pieces to fit them into the grid.

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the current piece horizontally.
2. Use the down arrow key to move the current piece down faster.
3. Use the space key to rotate the current piece.
4. Try to fit the pieces together to form complete lines.
5. When a line is complete, it will be cleared, and you will earn points.
6. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the grid and there is no more space to place new pieces.

## 4. Scoring

You earn points in Tetris by clearing lines. The scoring system is as follows:

- **1 line**: 100 points
- **2 lines**: 300 points
- **3 lines**: 500 points
- **4 lines**: 800 points

Try to clear as many lines as possible to achieve a high score!

## 5. Game Over

The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the grid and there is no more space to place new pieces. At that point, your score will be displayed, and you can choose to play again by closing and reopening the game window.

Enjoy playing Tetris and have fun!
