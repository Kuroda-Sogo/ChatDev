- The game starts with an empty grid, and random Tetris pieces will fall from the top.
- Use the arrow keys to move the pieces left, right, or down.
- Press the spacebar to rotate the pieces.
- When a horizontal line is completely filled with blocks, it will be cleared, and the player will earn points.
- The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the grid.

The scoring system in the Tetris game is as follows:

- Clearing one line: 100 points
- Clearing two lines: 200 points
- Clearing three lines: 300 points
- Clearing four lines (Tetris): 400 points

Try to clear as many lines as possible to achieve a high score!

## 5. Game Over

The game will end when the pieces stack up to the top of the grid, and the "Game Over" message will be displayed on the screen. Your final score will also be shown.
